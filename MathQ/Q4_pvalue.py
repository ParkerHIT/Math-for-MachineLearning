#A t-score, also known as a t-value, measures the number of standard deviations a data point is from the mean.
#It is commonly used in t-tests and regression analyses to indicate how distant an observation is from the mean.
#On the other hand, a p-value is the probability of obtaining results as extreme as the observed results,
#under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true. A lower p-value indicates stronger evidence against the null hypothesis.
#In Python, you can calculate the p-value from a t-score using the scipy.stats.t.sf() function.
#The syntax for this function is scipy.stats.t.sf(abs(t_score), df),
#where t_score is the t-score and df is the degrees of freedom

#Here's an example of how to calculate the p-value from a t-score in Python:

from scipy import stats

# Calculate the p-value for a two-tailed test
t_score = 2.0
df = 10
p_value = stats.t.sf(abs(t_score), df) * 2  # Multiply by 2 for a two-tailed test
print(p_value)
